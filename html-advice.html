                        <p> The purpose of HTML is to describe the structure and the content of the webpage and nothing else. Good HTML is written clearly, cleanly, consistently, and with a good structure. Valid HTML follows the conventions and best practices established by HTML 5 resources and ensures that nothing strange, broken or unexpected will happen when CSS, Javascript and other code is applied to the structure and content of the page.

                   <h4>Don’t use HTML for styling</h4>

                   <p>Styling instructions that set the amount of space above and below an element of text should be handled by CSS. Using the <br> tag to create extra space breaks the separation of markup and styling and will make the website behave unpredictably.</p>

                    <h4>Use the alt attribute to describe images for screen readers</h4>

                    <p>An accessible web is an inclusive one. People with visual impairments can’t see images, nor can search engines. Be sure to use the alt attribute with every img element and include an accurate description of the content of any image. </p>

                    <p>This will also help you debug your code if the image fails to load</p>

                    <h4>The head is for anything that only the browser sees. The body is for everything the user sees</h4>

                    <p>Anything that needs to be read, loaded and understood by the browser but not shown to the user should be enclosed in the head tag. This will include the page title, character set, meta information about how the page should load, and links to any linked files like stylesheets.</p>

                        <p>The actual content of the web page that should display in the browser and be seen by the user should instead by enclosed by the body tag. No user facing content should precede or follow body.</p>

                    <h4>Keep it clean and organized</h4>
                    <p>Having a clean and organized layout for your code will help you to edit, debug, and change your code when needed.</p>

                    <h4>Blank lines and indentation</h4>
                    <p>Having blank lines and indentations will make the code easier to read, but this should be done within reason. blank lines should only separate large blocks of code, the tab button should be avaoided and a double space used</p>
